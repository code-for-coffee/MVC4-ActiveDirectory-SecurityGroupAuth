Active Directory Security Group Authentication
Last edited: 1/17/14 by code-for-coffee

This is a sample MVC4 Project (Visual Studio 2010+) that demonstrates how to Authorize specific Active Directory Security Groups. 

This is just sample code and not designed to be used in a production environment; it is available to easily display the concept of how to accomplish this goal.

Please note specifics in:
* web.config (LDAP connection string and Active Directory membership)
* Controllers/HomeController.cs (displays the "[AuthorizeAD(Groups = 'SecurityGroup'") usage).
* Filters/AuthorizeADAttribute.cs (displays the implementation of "[AuthorizeAD]").
